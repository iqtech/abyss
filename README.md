Distributed graph storage based on Akka and Scala.

Check GraphTest to see how to use.

Run Maven with -DskipTests for better experience...

Run testStartN1, testStartN2, testStartN3, wait until cluster is up.
Start testCQRS or testReadHygFull (latter requires HYG-database and small path change in test).

It's only idea, not working product. More to come soon. Enjoy!
